Blog. Frog. Fog.

  
I’m honestly not sure what I’ll be putting here yet, but I wanted a space to post the different projects I hope to start in the coming year. My goal is to keep it simple—no ads, no distractions, just the ideas I’m working on (no matter how uninteresting they might be). Simple was the plan...right after the hours of setup and fine-tuning to get things to this point.

Enjoy!

### About Me

I'm a human. I can feel happy, sad, frustrated, embarrassed, excited, and proud (not in any particular order). I like to cook. I like to joke. I'm a social diplomat which helps me keep all of my amazing friends and make very few enemies. I like to dabble in security research (I hack legally), I would love to obtain a role as a penetration tester one day.
