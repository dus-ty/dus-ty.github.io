# <center> Got Git? </center>  
---  


Creating a personal website or blog doesn’t have to be complicated or costly. I wanted a simple, ad-free site to document my projects and ideas, and GitHub Pages turned out to be a new project I could use. Going this direction is a bit more technical then just signing up for a wordpress site, I consider myself a technical person and I had to do some googling and research to get it up and running. That doesn't mean its overly complicated, just means you will have to learn a couple things...(hold back your tears until the end).  


#### Step 1: Setting Up a GitHub Account  

Go to [GitHub](https://www.github.com) and click on sign up. Follow the prompts to create your account. You’ll need to provide a an email, password, then a username. Follow the setup steps, verify your email and your almost there.  

Now, with your new GitHub account, you’re ready to start building your GitHub Pages site!  


#### Step 2: Setting Up a Repository  

The first thing you need to create a GitHub Pages site is a GitHub repository. Here’s what I did:  

Go to GitHub and create a new repository.  
Name the repository [yourusername].github.io. (Replace [yourusername] with your actual GitHub username.) This name is essential because GitHub uses it to generate the website URL.  
I set it to public so anyone could view the content, and added a README file to get started with some basic content.  

Step 3: Configuring GitHub Pages  

With the repository set up, I enabled GitHub Pages:  

In my repository’s Settings, I scrolled down to the Pages section.  
I chose the main branch as the source for my GitHub Pages site, then saved the changes.  
After a few moments, GitHub generated a URL for my site: https://[yourusername].github.io. This would be the home of my new blog.
