### About Me

I'm a human. I can feel happy, sad, frustrated, embarrassed, excited, and proud (not in any particular order). I like to cook. I like to joke. I'm a social diplomat which helps me keep all of my amazing friends and make very few enemies. I like to dabble in security research (I hack legally), I would love to obtain a role as a penetration tester one day.
