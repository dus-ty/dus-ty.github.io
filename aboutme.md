### About Me

I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast, techie, and a constant learner. Welcome to my corner of the internet, where I share my projects, insights, and occasional experiments with technology.  


### My Journey

From tinkering with computers as a kid, evolving my interests into cybersecurity and open-source development, I’ve always been fascinated by how technology works. Now, I’m on a mission to:  
- Build cool projects  
- Share practical tutorials  
- Explore trends in cybersecurity and technology  

### Why This Blog?  

I started this blog as a way to document my learning journey and connect with others who are as curious about technology as I am. Whether it’s securing research, coding new projects, or just figuring out how things work, I believe in the power of sharing knowledge.

### Fun Facts  

- I dabble with python. (Not the snake, although both are dangerous)  
- I’m passionate about ethical hacking and teaching others how to stay secure online  
- In my free time, you can find me being a dad, gaming, doing bug bounty, Hack The Box, discord
